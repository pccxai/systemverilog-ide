# VS Code Prototype Adapter

This directory is an experimental local prototype for translating
pre-stable editor bridge JSON into VS Code-style data records and for
hosting a minimal local VS Code extension package scaffold.

The extension scaffold is not published, is not marketplace-ready, has no
LSP, and does not define a stable ABI/API.  It can consume the checked
examples under `docs/examples/editor-bridge` and can also run limited
live JSON flows from this source tree through the local command facade.
The current tests are static/smoke tests, not VS Code GUI integration
tests, and they run without npm install, Vivado, xsim, or hardware.

## Data Mapping

Problem payloads become diagnostic-like records:

- `error` -> `Error`
- `warning` -> `Warning`
- `info` or unknown severities -> `Information`
- CLI 1-based `line` / `column` values become 0-based
  `range.start.line` / `range.start.character`
- missing locations safely fall back to line `0`, character `0`

Declaration and locate payloads become navigation items that preserve
`name`, `kind`, `file`, `line`, and `column`, with additional 0-based
position fields for editor consumers.

## Live CLI Runner

`src/cli-runner.mjs` is the only subprocess layer.  It uses Node built-ins,
prefers `python` and falls back to `python3`, sets `PYTHONPATH=src`, runs
from the repository root, and passes arguments as arrays instead of shell
strings.  It only exposes helpers for known `pccx_ide_cli` JSON flows:

- `problems from-check <file> --format json`
- `problems from-xsim-log <log> --format json`
- `declarations <path> --format json`
- `locate <path> <name> --kind <kind> --format json`

`src/live-adapter.mjs` calls those known flows and translates successful
JSON payloads through the same adapter functions used by the checked
example path.  Failures return structured `ok`, `exitCode`, `stdout`,
`stderr`, and `error` fields for callers to surface.

## Command Facade

`bin/pccx-vscode-prototype.mjs` is a local command facade for the same
prototype translation layer.  It emits JSON only and requires callers to
choose an explicit mode:

```bash
node editors/vscode-prototype/bin/pccx-vscode-prototype.mjs diagnostics \
  --mode example --source check-missing-endmodule

node editors/vscode-prototype/bin/pccx-vscode-prototype.mjs diagnostics \
  --mode live --from-check fixtures/missing_endmodule.sv

node editors/vscode-prototype/bin/pccx-vscode-prototype.mjs navigation \
  --mode example --source declarations

node editors/vscode-prototype/bin/pccx-vscode-prototype.mjs navigation \
  --mode live --locate fixtures/modules pkg_defs --kind package
```

The facade supports checked-example mode and live CLI mode for known
flows only.  It does not silently fall back between modes, does not use
shell interpolation, and does not accept arbitrary command strings.

## Extension Package Scaffold

`package.json` and `src/extension.mjs` define a minimal experimental local
VS Code extension scaffold.  The package is `private`, has version
`0.0.0`, and intentionally has no publisher, npm dependencies, VS Code
test runner, bundler, `vsce`, or marketplace publishing script.

The contributed commands are:

- `pccxSystemVerilog.showDiagnosticsExample`
- `pccxSystemVerilog.showNavigationExample`
- `pccxSystemVerilog.runDiagnosticsLive`
- `pccxSystemVerilog.runNavigationLive`

The command handlers are thin wrappers around the local facade.  They
build known facade argument arrays and run
`bin/pccx-vscode-prototype.mjs`; they do not call `pccx_ide_cli`
directly, do not invoke raw shell command strings, and do not accept
arbitrary command execution.  Live paths are still prototype-only and are
passed to known facade flows as argument-array entries.

This scaffold is not LSP, not a full IDE replacement, not a stable
ABI/API, and not a marketplace-ready or published extension.

## Local Smoke

```bash
node editors/vscode-prototype/test/adapter.test.mjs
node editors/vscode-prototype/test/cli-runner.test.mjs
node editors/vscode-prototype/test/facade.test.mjs
node editors/vscode-prototype/test/extension-manifest.test.mjs
node editors/vscode-prototype/test/extension-entrypoint.test.mjs
bash scripts/vscode-adapter-smoke.sh
```

The adapter can also print translated examples:

```bash
node editors/vscode-prototype/src/adapter.mjs diagnostics \
  docs/examples/editor-bridge/problems-xsim-mixed.example.json

node editors/vscode-prototype/src/adapter.mjs navigation \
  docs/examples/editor-bridge/declarations.example.json
```
